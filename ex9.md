## prompt
  
please help me coding.<br>
I need a program for stream LED with 500ms.<br>
The sequence is LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4. <br>
The LED is negtive logic. <br>
I want to use systick for delay. <br>
I want all code in main.c <br>
add SYSTICK_TimerStart(); <br>
MCU is PIC32CM3204GV00048. <br>
I had set MCC below <br>
-GPIO of PA00 as LED1. <br>
-GPIO of PA01 as LED2. <br>
-GPIO of PA10 as LED3. <br>
-GPIO of PA11 as LED4. <br>
